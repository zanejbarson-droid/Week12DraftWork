# What?
This is an upload of my EarSketch coding project called 'Diverse Sound'
Look at Main.py for code - Copy and paste code into EarSketch

# Why?
I have made a song that transitions through genres in order to demonstrate the diversity of sound created through coding.

# External Libraries
I have also used a lot of sounds that are saved to my device that are exhibited that have been uploaded into my earsketch project
